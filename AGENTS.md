# MahekOne

Mahek Marketing India's connected workspace. One database, one design system,
many apps. The CRM is the first — built for the telecaller team and their
managers. Dispatch, inventory and accounts join later on the same schema.

## Stack

- **Next.js 16** (App Router, React 19, Server Components + Server Actions)
- **Postgres** on Neon, provisioned through the Vercel Marketplace
- **Drizzle ORM** — schema in `src/db/schema.ts`
- **Tailwind v4** — design tokens in `src/app/globals.css` under `@theme`
- **Auth** — email + password, admin-created, scrypt hashes, DB-backed sessions

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # localhost:3000
npm run build        # production build (runs tsc)
npm run db:push      # push schema changes to Neon
npm run db:seed      # wipe and reseed with demo data (also clears sessions)
npm run db:studio    # Drizzle Studio
npx eslint src       # lint, including the React Compiler rules
```

Environment comes from `.env.local`, pulled with `vercel env pull`. Only
`DATABASE_URL` is required.

## How sign-in works

**One sign-in for all of MahekOne** — there is no per-app login. `/login` takes
a work number *or* an email, because telecallers know their phone and office
staff know their email.

Where you land depends on what you can open:

- **one app** → straight into it, no launcher (a single option is not a choice)
- **several** → `/apps`, the launcher
- **none** → `/apps`, which says so plainly instead of showing a blank screen

`app_access` is a row per user per app. It is checked in each app's layout, not
just used to hide launcher tiles — a bookmarked `/orders` must not open for
somebody who was never given it.

**Signing in opens an attendance record for the day; signing out closes it.** A
second sign-in the same day reopens the same row, so a lunch break does not read
as two shifts.

## Layout

## Rules that keep the data honest

**Money is paise.** Integers everywhere; formatted only in `lib/format.ts` on
the way to the screen. Never store rupees.

**Reads live in `lib/queries.ts`; writes live in `lib/actions/`.** A number on
the dashboard and the same number on its own screen come from the same
function, so they cannot drift apart.

**Outstanding is derived, never typed.** `recomputeOutstanding()` rebuilds it
from bills after anything that touches a bill or a payment.

**The working day is Asia/Kolkata.** `today()` in `lib/format.ts` is the only
source. Day windows in SQL carry an explicit `+05:30` — without it Postgres
reads them in the server's timezone and a 9 am call falls outside "today".

**Scope, not roles, filters lists.** `getScope()` returns `mine` or `team`.
Telecallers are pinned to `mine`; the cookie cannot widen it. Managers default
to `team` because their own book is usually empty.

**Manager-only actions are checked server-side** in the action, not just
disabled in the UI. Disabled buttons always carry a `title` saying why.

**Saving a call is one transaction** — the interaction, any order, reminder or
complaint it produced, the queue row and the customer's rolled-up figures.
Half-saved calls are how telecaller data goes wrong.

**A WhatsApp message is only "Sent" when a human confirms it.** Until then it
sits as `Copied`, and the log counts those separately — a customer who may or
may not have been contacted is visible rather than assumed.

## React Compiler

The React Compiler lint rules are on and the build is clean. Two consequences:

- **Do not reset state in an effect when a prop changes.** Give the component a
  `key` and let it remount with fresh initial state. Every modal and drawer here
  does this; see `ConfirmDialog` and `CallPanel`.
- **Do not read the clock during render.** `Date.now()` and `new Date()` are
  impure. Read the clock in a server component via `nowMs()` and pass the value
  down as a prop.

## Adding the next MahekOne app

Every app already has a login, an entry on the launcher, access control,
attendance and a switcher — only its own screens are missing. To build one:

1. Add its tables to `src/db/schema.ts` — same file, same database. Reference
   `customers` and `users` directly rather than copying them.
2. Flip `built: true` on its entry in `src/lib/apps.ts`, and point `href` at its
   first real screen.
3. Replace `src/app/<app>/page.tsx` (currently an `AppPlaceholder`) with the app
   itself. Gate its layout on `listUserApps()` the way `src/app/crm/layout.tsx`
   does.
4. Give it a launcher count and status line in `launcherApps()` so its tile says
   what is waiting inside — and make the badge count the same thing the sentence
   describes.
5. Reads go in `lib/queries.ts`, writes in a new `lib/actions/<app>.ts`.

Nothing about the CRM is private to it, so nothing has to be duplicated or
synced later.
